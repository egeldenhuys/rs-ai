## Problem:
The client requires ~~artificial intelligence~~ a bot to perform certain tasks in the MMORPG 
[RuneScape](http://www.runescape.com/). The AI has to be able to perform many tasks.
The most important task is to generate in game coins using multiple methods.
The client wants to be able to interact with the AI using a console.
Statistics should be shown about the AI, such as how long it has been playing, how many coins generated.
The client also wants to see an estimate of how many coins each method will generate per hour.
Multiple AI needs to be able to perform tasks at a time on the same computer. A library of functions will help the client to create his own AI in the future.

## Needs
These are the most basic ways to describe the needs of the client. To see the features that have been worked out further and are in greater detail see the [Project Breakdown](Project-Breakdown) document.

- AI methods
- Mouse simulation
- Keyboard simulation
- OCR
- Console
- Statistics
- Human Behaviour
- Multiple instances on the same computer
- Library
