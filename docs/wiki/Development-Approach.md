This project will follow the **prototyping approach**.

The following reasons support using this approach:
- The client is not familiar with this field of programming (AI). This approach will help get the needs from the client as prototypes will continuously be created and presented to the client and peers. 
- There are few well documented features/methods that already exists and as such new and creative methods need to be designed.
- Since the requirements of the solution can change quickly with this project the prototyping approach will be most helpful.

1. **Define:** Similar to the structured approach but on a smaller scale.
The definition created is limited to the prototype being developed.
Generally the prototype is a representation of the features that will be included in the final product.
 
1. **Plan:** Again similar to the structured approach but is focused at the prototype itself.
Generally prototypes do not have as much documentation such as context or data flow diagrams but
include documents such as algorithms or other explanations of how a certain feature works.

1. **Build:** Building the prototype is the same as any other approach but may make heavy use of CASE tools.

1. **Reviewing:** Reviewing the prototype involves either the client or peers of the developer
checking the prototype to see if it should be included in the final product, modified before being
included or scrapped.
